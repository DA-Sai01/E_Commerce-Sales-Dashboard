# ðŸ“Š Power BI E-Commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard 

This project presents an end-to-end interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze the performance of a fictional e-commerce business over a span of 3 years (2023â€“2025). The dataset contains over **30,000 transactions** and includes customer, product, sales, return, and operational details.

The dashboard was designed to help decision-makers explore key business questions related to customer behavior, sales growth, product performance, and operational efficiency â€” all through clear visual storytelling and dynamic filters.

##  Objective

To create a self-service analytics solution that enables:
- Fast, intuitive exploration of large-scale e-commerce data
- Performance tracking across customers, orders, and products
- Business insight discovery without needing to write queries

---

##  Data Modeling & Preparation

- Cleaned and enriched the data with custom fields: `Age Group`, `Order Time Buckets`, and `Month-Year`
- Built a **star schema model** with a separate `Date` dimension for time intelligence
- Ensured relationships supported context-aware DAX calculations
- Removed redundancy, filtered out nulls, and ensured granularity consistency

---

##  Dashboard Overview

The report is structured into **three dedicated pages**, each focused on a core aspect of the business:

###  Orders Page
Tracks overall order health and behavior:
- Monthly order trends with **MoM % change**
- Order status breakdown: Completed, Refunded, Failed
- Payment mode distribution (UPI, Card, COD, etc.)
- Peak order time analysis across weekdays and time slots

###  Product Page
Helps assess product-level performance and profitability:
- Top products by sales, quantity, and ratings
- **Return rate** by category
- Profit and margin calculations

###  Customer Page
Visualizes who the customers are and how they behave:
- Age group and gender segmentation
- Preferred payment modes by demographic
- Region-wise sales performance
- Order quantity and value trends by customer segment

---

##  KPIs & DAX Measures

Custom DAX measures were used to calculate key performance indicators:

- `Return_Rate = DIVIDE(Total_Returns, Total_Orders)`
- `MoM_Sales_Change` using `PREVIOUSMONTH()` and `DIVIDE()`
- `Avg_Profit_Per_Unit = SUM(Profit) / SUM(Quantity)`
- Additional KPIs:
  - Total Orders
  - Total Sales
  - Quantity Sold
  - Avg. Sales per Order
  - Refund Amounts
  - Profit & Margin

##  Visuals Used

The dashboard includes a mix of strategic and operational visuals:

- **Line & Clustered Column Charts** â€“ Sales trends vs MoM growth
- **100% Stacked Bars** â€“ Breakdown of payment and order status
- **Donut Charts** â€“ Contribution by region or category
- **KPI Cards & Area Charts** â€“ High-level metrics
- **Slicers & Tooltips** â€“ Dynamic filters for years, regions, and platforms

##  Key Insights Uncovered

Here are just a few of the actionable insights surfaced by the dashboard:

- **UPI** is the most preferred payment method (~54% usage)
- Customers aged **25â€“34** show the highest purchase frequency and order value
- **Clothing & Electronics** are top-performing but also carry higher return rates
- Sales from **Asia and Europe** dominate, but **Australia** is growing rapidly YoY
- **Peak shopping hours** fall between **Evening and Night**, especially on weekends
